            About Us
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-4">
          We embarked on a journey fueled by a simple question, “Why does the admission process have to be so difficult for parents, students, and education organizations?” And that gave birth to the first-in-industry application automation platform for education organizations, with NoPaperForms becoming our identity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-4">
          We kept scaling the depth and breadth of our product, and our solutions expanded within the education industry, from EdTech Companies, Coaching & Training Institutes, Study Abroad Consultants, K12 Schools, Play & Pre-Schools to Higher Education Institutions.
